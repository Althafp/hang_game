## Requirements

Before you begin, you need to install the following tools:

- `nilup`, an installer and version manager for the [Nillion SDK tools](https://docs.nillion.com/nillion-sdk-and-tools). Install nilup:

  _For the security-conscious, please download the `install.sh` script, so that you can inspect how
  it works, before piping it to `bash`._

  ```
  curl https://nilup.nilogy.xyz/install.sh | bash
  ```

  - Confirm `nilup` installation
    ```
    nilup -V
    ```

- [Nillion SDK tools](https://docs.nillion.com/nillion-sdk-and-tools) Use `nilup` to install these:
  ```bash
  nilup install latest
  nilup use latest
  nilup init
  ```
  - Confirm global Nillion tool installation
    ```
    nillion -V
    ```
- [Node (>= v18.17)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

  - Check version with
    ```
    node -v
    ```

- [python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) version 3.11 or higher with a working [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/getting-started/) installed

  - Confirm that you have python3 (version >=3.11) and pip installed:
    ```
    python3 --version
    python3 -m pip --version
    ```

- Yarn ([v1](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) or [v2+](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install))
  - Check version with
    ```
    yarn -v
    ```
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

To use Scaffold-ETH 2 with Nillion, you need to have the MetaMask Flask browser extension installed and to store your Nillion user key in MetaMask Snaps

1. Install the [MetaMask Flask browser extension](https://docs.metamask.io/snaps/get-started/install-flask/) that will let you work with experimental snaps.
2. Create a new test wallet in MetaMask Flask
3. Temporarily disable any other wallet browser extensions (Classic MetaMask, Rainbow Wallet, etc.) while using MetaMask Flask
4. [Visit the Nillion Key Management UI](https://nillion-snap-site.vercel.app/) to generate a user key and store it in MetaMask Snaps - this saves your user key within MetaMask so it can be used by other Nillion web apps
5. This quickstart will ask you to "Connect to Snap" to use your Nillion user key
